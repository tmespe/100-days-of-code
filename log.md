# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on implementing a Twitter search for the Umigon lexical NLP project.

**Thoughts** Not sure if I should translate the heuristics into regex or just output tweets. Needs to be discussed with [Cl√©ment](https://github.com/seinecle).
