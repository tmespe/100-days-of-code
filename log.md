# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on implementing a Twitter search for the Umigon lexical NLP project.

**Thoughts** Not sure if I should translate the heuristics into regex or just output tweets. Needs to be discussed with [Cl√©ment](https://github.com/seinecle).

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on updating my code on [Brightspace Downloader](https://github.com/tmespe/brightspace_downloader) and [Gamepass_api](https://github.com/tmespe/gamepass_api) with better comments and Typing.


### Day 3: January 11, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've finished several assignments on DataCamp on Deep Learning

**Today's Progress**: I've finished several sections on the dplyr R package on Datacamp

### Day 5: January 13, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on setting up the base class for the Umigon project. It will take a language term and return tweets for the given term.

### Day 6: January 14, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the Umigon tweet retriever. Set up the search_tweets method using the [Twarc](https://twarc-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.

### Day 7: January 15, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the inital publish of the umigon_tweet_retriever. The base functionality should be working. 

**Thoughts** Still needs more testing and I need to investigate more about Twitter's rate throttling.
